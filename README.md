# Motion-Ocean

[TOC]

Motion Ocean lets you create Inverse Dynamics models of humans from motion and force data in order to study the kinematics, dynamics, and energetics of human movements.  Unlike other Inverse Dynamics software, tracking of motion markers and the assignment of motion markers to specific body parts can be handled automatically.  Additionally, Motion Ocean can detect different types of locomotion and provide activity-specific analysis.  For example, if the data is of someone walking, it can detect when gait events such as heel-strikes and toe-offs, and segment the data according to those events in order to analyze the data on a per-step basis.
